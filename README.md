## General Information
For Part 1 of the challenge, I had to scrape the scrape the data from the Mars News Site to extract the titles and previews for each article. Then store the data as a Python dictionary and export to a JSON file.

For Part 2 fo the challenge, I used automated browsing to scrape and analyze the Mars Weather Site.  I extracted the table and converted the data to a Pandas DataFrame.  From the dataframe, I analyzed the data for to compare Martian days/months to Earth and created plots to reflect the average minimum temperatures and average pressure.
